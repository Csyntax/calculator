## Overview

This project is a simple calculator and timer application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations, percentage calculation, exponentiation, and timer functionalities for counting up and down.

The application consists of three main components:

1. **HTML (`index.html`):** Defines the structure of the calculator and timer interface. It includes buttons for numbers, operators, and timer controls.

2. **CSS (`styles.css`):** Provides styles for the calculator, timer controls, buttons, and overall layout. It ensures a responsive and visually appealing design.

3. **JavaScript (`javaScript.js`):** Implements the functionality of the calculator and timer. It handles user inputs, evaluates expressions, updates the display, and manages timer operations.

## Features

- Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Additional functions: Percentage calculation, exponentiation.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Timer functionalities: Count up from 0.00 and count down from a specified duration.
- Clear and delete buttons for input control.
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs.
- Stylish and modern user interface.
- Plus/Minus button to toggle the sign of the input.
- Reset button for the timer.

## Usage
